# Deployment Documentation Notice

## Changes to Deployment Documentation

The deployment documentation has been consolidated into a single comprehensive guide:

- **[DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](../DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)** - This unified guide replaces the previous separate documents and covers:
  - SDK-based Agent Management 
  - Direct Deployment
  - Troubleshooting
  - Best Practices

## Previous Deployment Documents

The following documents have been moved to the backup directory and are now deprecated:

- `DIRECT_DEPLOY.md` - Guide for direct deployment to Vertex AI Agent Engine
- `AGENT_ENGINE_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Guide for Vertex AI Agent Engine deployment

## Reference from Other Documents

All references from other documentation files have been updated to point to the new unified deployment guide.
