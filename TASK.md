# Project Tasks

## Current Tasks

- **Task**: Create an automated redeployment script.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-22)
  - **Details**: Created a new `redeploy.py` script that automates the deployment process by executing the deploy_agent_engine.py script and automatically updating the chat.py configuration with the new Agent Engine ID. The script includes backup functionality and error handling.

- **Task**: Update project visualization files for consistency with codebase changes.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-22)
  - **Details**: Updated project_visualization.md and project_visualization.html to align with recent codebase changes. Removed references to search_agent.py and added information about new files like chat.py, deploy_agent_engine.py, and the registry pattern. Updated component relationships and interaction diagrams to reflect the current architecture.

- **Task**: Create a documentation index file.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-22)
  - **Details**: Created a new `docs/index.md` file that serves as a central documentation index with links to all key documentation files. The index helps developers navigate the various documentation resources available in the project.

- **Task**: Review and update DOCUMENTATION_1.md for consistency with other documentation.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-22)
  - **Details**: Updated DOCUMENTATION_1.md to ensure consistency with PLANNING.md. Added references to the new PLANNING.md document, updated the project structure section, added a new Documentation Resources section, expanded the References section, and updated the conclusion to explain the relationship between documents.

- **Task**: Update project documentation to reflect current code structure and features.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-22)
  - **Details**: Updated README.md to reflect current project structure, removed references to non-existent files like `PLANNING_1.md` and `test_search_agent.py`, added references to new files like `chat.py`, `registry.py`, and updated documentation links.

- **Task**: Create a centralized planning document to replace the missing `PLANNING_1.md`.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-22)
  - **Details**: Created a new `docs/PLANNING.md` document that outlines the architecture, design decisions, and roadmap for the project based on information gathered from the codebase review.

- **Task**: Debug and fix Vertex AI Agent Engine deployment failure (500 error).
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-21
  - **Status**: Completed (2025-04-21)
  - **Details**: Deployment failed with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'src'`. Fixed by adding `extra_packages=['./src']` to `agent_engines.create` call in `deploy_agent_engine.py`. Also created `chat.py` to interact with the deployed agent via SDK due to lack of Console UI and `gcloud` support.

## Completed Tasks

## Discovered During Work

- **Task**: Create user guide for local development and deployment.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Details**: Need to create a comprehensive user guide that explains the differences between local development options (`python run.py run base --interactive`, `python run.py run base --web`) and deployment options (`python deploy_agent_engine.py`, `python redeploy.py`). This will help developers understand how to use the various tools correctly.

- **Task**: Consider refactoring the agent structure to make it more modular and easier to extend.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Details**: Currently, we rely heavily on the base_agent.py file. Consider creating a cleaner inheritance structure for different agent types.

- **Task**: Consider consolidating DOCUMENTATION_1.md and PLANNING.md.
  - **Date Added**: 2025-04-22
  - **Status**: Pending
  - **Details**: We currently have two detailed documentation files that overlap in some areas. Consider consolidating them into a single comprehensive document or creating a clearer separation of concerns between them.
